version 2.0.0
_________________________

UPDATE:
v2.0.0 : 20201026
	Updated for External Exams
	Used tables for spacing of timings
	Manual timings page added
v1.5.2 : 20140901
	Update to allow for perusal to be set independantly of the exam start time.
	This is to reflect the QCS requirements for the starting instructions to be begun to be read out exactly 10 minutes after start of perusal.
	e.g. perusal: 9:00.00, *start* reading 9:10.00 - could be 60 seconds of instructions, so start exam at 9:11.00

	Changes made to allow for this:
	Perusal button 
	On page load hiding of start button
	On perusal button click - put perusal start time into perusal section
                        - hide perusal button
                        - unhide start button
	on start button click - fill in the rest of the timings (changes made to account for this)
                      - hide start button
                      - black placeholder put in place to keep formatting looking okay.
